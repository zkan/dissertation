\section{Conclusion}

So far I've only focussed on lane detection with the camera mounted in front of 
the camera. I was able to develop a system that was able to detect the road 
lanes. The system was able to estimate the distance to the lane boundary. 
Although the system needs to be more robust in situation where false lane 
marking is detected or when no lane marking is detected.  



\section{Future Works}
One of the constraint in my system was that lane marking are straight line. This 
is not always true. There are curved lane marking as well. I plane to develop a 
new road model that would allow my system to work in scenes where the lane 
marking are curved. 

The remainder part of the thesis would focus on road lane detection where the 
camera is mounted at the side of the road.
