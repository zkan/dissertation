My research work was accomplished through the support of many
people. I would like to thank all of them here.

First, my deepest thanks and a special word of appreciation go to 
my beloved parents, who always inspire and give me endless unconditional 
love and support. I dedicate this piece of work to them.

Second, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my advisor, 
Dr.\ Matthew N.\ Dailey, for giving me invaluable advice, excellent 
guidance, strong encouragement and support throughout the study with his
kindness and cordial attitude. I also thank him for being very patient
with me and always willingly answering all my questions.

Third, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to my committee 
members, Dr.\ Nitin V.\ Afzulpurkar, Dr.\ Supavadee Aramvith, 
and Dr.\ Sanparith Marukatat, for their valuable suggestions
and constructive criticism.

Fourth, I would like to thank the Royal Thai Government for their 
graduate scholarship throughout my studies at AIT. Without the 
scholarship, studying at AIT would be impossible.

Finally, I am very grateful to have been a part of the AIT Vision and 
Graphics Lab (VGL). I am thankful to all of the lab members for 
valuable discussions and comments on this work. Special thanks are 
due to Shashi Gharti, who assisted with the implementation of human 
tracking and feature extraction, and Phattanapon Rhienmora, who has 
been encouraging and supporting me during my Ph.D.\ life.

Video surveillance systems have become widespread tools for monitoring
and law enforcement in public areas.  Due to increasing crime, video
surveillance systems are being deployed in more and more places.
Video surveillance systems are needed to help security personnel
prevent and respond to criminal activity in a timely fashion.
However, human monitoring becomes increasingly expensive and
ineffective as the amount of video data increases. Also, manual review of
all video footage is time-intensive and error-prone.

Automated anomaly detection can help to improve the effectiveness of
human observers by separating the video stream into a sequence of
``normal'' and ``unusual'' events. However, much of the existing work
has many limitations in this direction. Oftentimes, separate models
for each distinct a priori known class of ``normal'' behavior are
assumed.  This could lead to the problem of typical behavior evolving
and becoming more diverse to the point that the false alarm rates
increase.  The naive solution would be to retain all of the
observation data and retrain the system periodically, but this
requires storing all of the incoming data, requiring too much disk
space. In this dissertation, we therefore propose and evaluate an
efficient method for incremental automatic identification of
suspicious behavior in video surveillance data.

First, we develop a blob extraction method that segments blobs and an
appearance-based blob tracking method that uses a forward-backward
overlap method and color coherence vectors (CCVs) to maintain identity
through blob merging and splitting cases.

Second, we propose a new method for detecting shadows using a simple
maximum likelihood formulation based on HSV color information. We find
that the method outperforms standard shadow detection methods on three
different real-world video surveillance data sets.

Third, we propose a new method for clustering human behaviors in the
context of video surveillance that is suitable for bootstrapping an
anomaly detection module for intelligent video surveillance
systems. We show that the method is extremely effective in separating
anomalous from typical behaviors on real-world testbed video
surveillance data.

Fourth, we propose a \textit{semi-supervised} batch anomaly
detection method that self-calibrates itself from a small bootstrap
set in which each bootstrap sequence is manually labeled as normal or
suspicious by a human operator. Our method proves extremely effective,
with a very low false alarm rate at a 100\% hit rate.

Finally, we propose an effective behavior modeling and suspicious
activity detection method extending the batch method that
incrementally learns scene-specific statistical models of human
behavior without requiring storage of historical data. The incremental
method's false alarm rate drops below that of the batch method on the
same data.

In experimental evaluations on real-world testbed video surveillance
data sets, the proposed methods prove to be practical and effective at
inducing scene-specific statistical models useful for bringing
suspicious behavior to the attention of human security personnel.
